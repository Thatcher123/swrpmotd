Thanks for playing on Poseidon Servers Jailbreak!

We know that rules aren't very fun, but to ensure that all players have an enjoyable experience, we've a set of rules that all players must abide by; please ensure that you have read and fully understand these rules, as you will be held accountable if you break them. These are subject to change at any time, so try to keep current to avoid causing headaches for staff!

# How do I play Jailbreak?

// start tutorial <!-- Start a div surrounding the gamemode tutorial -->

So you've stumbled upon the world of Jailbreak, but don't know where to get started with the gamemode... Don't worry, friend, I'll try and help you get your foot in the door! Although it may seem intimidating at first, once you get the hand of it, Jailbreak can be a lot of fun. Don't suffice this tutorial for a full introduction to our server, though, as you should always read the rules before playing!

To start off, Jailbreak consists of two primary teams; these are the *prisoners*, who spawn in cells and follow the warden's orders, and the *guards*, who manage the prison! The guards team, and especially the *warden*, are in charge of orchestrating days, keeping track of prisoners, and most importantly, creating a fun and enjoyable experience for the prisoners team. The prisoners, on the other hand, have the option of participating in the warden's days and attempting to become the last prisoner alive, or if they dislike the games being played, rebelling, and trying to eliminate the guards team!

Whilst on the guards team, you must keep track of the prisoners during the day, and ensure that no prisoners try to rebel. You must follow the orders of the warden at all times, or alternatively, you may type "/warden", or hit F4, at the start of the round to claim warden yourself! As the warden, your role is the create games and activities for the prisoners to try and kill off all but one, whom then gets a Last Request, or LR. It's recommended that, before you take the role of warden, you get plenty of experience from watching other players in the role and spending time on the prisoners team!

Speaking of prisoners... As a prisoner, you have the choice of following the warden's orders and trying to survive through the day, or rebelling, and attempting to eliminate the guards team. The warden will try different tricks to pick off prisoners, often even whilst you're still in your cell, so be cunning and listen very closely to what the warden says! If you manage to become the last prisoner left alive, you will get an LR, which allows you to suggest something to be played the following day, although it may be denied; alternatively, you can hit F4 to pit yourself one-on-one with a guard, and try to pick off the remaining guards to win the round!

Hopefully this small introduction has helped you get more comfortable with the gamemode, and I wish you, dear reader, lots of fun whilst playing! Remember that Jailbreak is **not** a Team Deathmatch gamemode, and allowing both teams to have fun is important, so try and refrain from rebelling too often!

  Rules pertaining to the Jailbreak gamemode
-->

# Jailbreak Rules

0. Use your common sense. If you feel like you're doing something wrong, stop.
0. Freekilling/RDM/Teamkilling will not be tolerated.
0. Do not give intentional "freedays" under any circumstances.
    - This excludes "first day freedays" which occur after a map change.
    - Freedays may not be given as a last request.
0. Do not intentionally stall or delay the round (this includes cell days) or hide and wait for prolonged periods (camping).
0. The warden must communicate appropriately, whether it be by talking over voice chat or placing waypoints; if you can't communicate clearly, don't become the warden.
    - Waypoints may be placed by holding C, or whichever key you have bound to context menu. Note that waypoints do not count as specific orders, and must always be accompanied with a command.
    - It is advised you refrain from becoming the warden if your mic is of poor quality or you are hard to understand, as it just makes it difficult for those who are trying to listen to you and carry out your orders.
0. Guards must obey and protect the warden at all times. This means do what he says, when he says it.
0. Prisoners and guards may refuse an order that will lead to **certain** death.
    - If you are ordered to jump off of a building, or do anything else that will endanger your life, you may refuse the order.
    - Orders that lead to the possibility of death may not be refused, such as games intended to kill off prisoners.
0. Guards are not to bring or distribute weapons to prisoners under any circumstances. Failure to follow this rule will result in a lengthy ban.
    - It is recommended that you enable "double press to drop" in the settings (accessible by pressing F1) to avoid accidental gunplanting.
0. Do not ghost/metagame. If you are dead, do not give the prisoners or guards that are still alive any information that may have an effect on the day.
    - This includes answers to trivia questions; it's a test of their wit, not yours.
    - Do not give rebellers hints that may heighten their chance at success, such as when hallways are clear, guard locations, or informing them of gun/vent locations. The reverse also applies, as you shouldn't give guards information on rebeller's whereabouts.
    - "Fake ghosting" may still be considered ghosting if it has an effect on the day.
0. Guards cannot interfere with a prisoner's LR. If they're having a battle, do not shoot the prisoner.
    - However, if the prisoner is targeting guards other than their LR opponent, this counts as rebelling, and the prisoner may be considered KOS.
    - A prisoner may be killed during their LR if they were rebelling before they initiated it and a warden has not pardoned them.
0. Kill prisoners within reason. If they have a knife, don't just gun them down, you must ask them to drop it first.
    - If a prisoner is in possession of a gun, holstered or otherwise, they may be KOS.
0. You are not allowed to camp the armory. Once you have chosen your weaponry, you should leave it immediately.
0. Do not close cells once they have been opened, unless prisoners are to enter them later in the day.
0. If a warden has not given an order before 60 seconds into the start of a round, the day becomes a freeday.
    - If this occurs, do not keep prisoners in their cells, open the cells if they don't open automatically.
    - Cell orders, such as touching and facing cell doors, count as orders.
0. You cannot prevent a prisoner from doing their LR, and neither prisoners nor guards may use the medic bay or health kits during LRs.
    - If a day is still in progress (i.e. "the first prisoner to reach the end gets LR"), but everyone else dies, the warden may refuse to give the last prisoner an LR until the day is complete.
0. All guards must communicate clearly with working microphones, and all guards must be willing to go warden. Refer to rule no. 5.
    - You must have, and actively use, a working microphone to be on the guards team.
    - If you are not willing to take the role of warden, you shouldn't be on the guards team.
    - Guards may only give simple orders, such as "drop your weapon", or "get back in line"; Leave the complex orders to the warden.
0. If there are conflicting orders, the most recent order takes priority.
    - For example, if the warden states that leaving the circle is KOS, then instructs the prisoners to move to the square, leaving the circle is no longer KOS, as the movement order takes priority.
    - This rule is excepted during Simon Says, so listen closely. For example, Simon must state that leaving the circle is no longer KOS.
0. If you are the last guard alive you may KOS anyone who is holding a weapon. You may also take the position of warden and attempt to give new orders, at which point non-compliant prisoners are rebelling.
    - The last guard may never "kill all" without a valid, rule-abiding reason, such as a war day.
0. We aren't here to simply win rounds, but to allow both teams to have fun. Don't make killing everyone and winning the round your main objective, but instead, try to have fun and give everyone a chance to contribute and survive.
    - If you are on the prisoners team, don't rebel every round. Rebelling is a healthy component of the game, although it's simply not fun in excess.
    - Try to avoid games and activities that remove a large group of prisoners purely based on chance. It's disappointing to miss out on a day simply because luck wasn't in your favour.
    - Furthermore, days which may be considered cruel and unfair for prisoners, such as Faze Clan recruitment day, are prohibited.
0. No prop surfing or killing.
0. Do not repeat games or days. For example, if there was a war day last round, don't play another one.
0. Cell days are prohibited.
    - Prisoners must be out of their cells by one and a half minutes after the start of a round.
    - Cells may be used for games later in the day, although not in excess.
0. Games or days that require the use of the developer console are prohibited.
0. As a guard, do not open cell doors without the warden's permission.
    - Don't start a map game without the warden's consent, or hit buttons you've been told not to. Any deaths as a result will be considered RDM.
0. First day special days which involve prisoners spawning with weapons are to be treated as war days; any other first day special day will continue to be considered a freeday.
0. Cheap tricks which are used to confuse and kill off prisoners are prohibited.
    - For example, unclear instructions, conflicting instructions/waypoints, or talking in a way that is too fast or unclear.
0. If any invincible props, such as barricades, are being used to prop-block an area, item pickup must be enabled.

## Commands

0. **AFK Freeze**
    - While AFK frozen, you are not allowed to move in any direction, jump, crouch, look around, have your fists raised, use your mic, or use your flashlight (it must be disabled). TL;DR, just don't touch your keyboard or mouse.
    - Text chatting is allowed, and may never be prevented by the warden.
    - No, just because you have something on toggle, or your mic is bound to your mouse, doesn't mean you're not KOS. The guards don't know that.
0. **Freeze**
    - Anything may be allowed except pressing any of your movement keys, crouching, or jumping.
0. **Crouch Walk**
    - Move whilst holding your crouch key, bound to left control by default.
0. **Alt Walk**
    - Move whilst holding your walk key, bound to alt by default, hence the name.
0. **Unstack shoulder-to-shoulder**
    - Don't stack inside other players, and spread out shoulder-to-shoulder with the other prisoners, forming a line.
    - The warden must specify a place to do this, such as "unstack shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the cell stairs".
0. **No Detours or Delays**
    - If a warden tells a prisoner to move somewhere "no detours or delays", they must not detour away from the destination or delay going there, or they will be KOS.
    - Unless a time is specified to get there, no detours or delays always applies. If a time is specified, you may take your time getting there, as long as you arrive by the specified time.

## Special Days

0. **Free Day**
    - If the warden dies, or the warden hasn't given an order before one minute passes, the day becomes a freeday.
    - During a freeday prisoners are free to do whatever they please, as long as they do not pick up weapons or enter KOS zones, such as vents or the armory.
0. **Hide and Seek**
    - Once the warden has speicifed the current round is going to be a hide and seek day, all guards must stay in the armory, excluding one guard that should open cell doors. Once cell doors have been opened, the prisoners may run out of their cells to find somewhere on the map to hide.
    - When the timer hits the time specified earlier by the warden, the guards may leave the armory and begin looking for prisoners. Guards may not kill prisoners before the specified time unless the prisoner is in the armory.
0. **Reverse Hide and Seek**
    - This is the reverse of a hide and seek day; all of the guards may find a hiding spot across the map, except for one who stays back to open cell doors, assuming the map doesn't open them automatically.
    - All guards must either use their melee or secondary weapons during a reverse hide and seek day, otherwise it's just a war day with camping.
0. **War Day**
    - The warden must specify a time, and once that time has been reached, all prisoners become KOS.
    - The guards must keep war days fair for prisoners, so the guards must allow prisoners to enter the armory and pick up weapons.
    - Save the camping for reverse hide and seek.
0. **Lava Day**
    - The floor is lava! After a specified time, all prisoners must be off of their cell floors, and/or on an object in their cell, otherwise they are KOS.
    - Lava days end once prisoners are instructed to leave their cells or move off of an object, except during Simon Says.
0. **Extermination/Execution Day**
    - After a specified time, all prisoners that can be seen in their cells are KOS, so prisoners must hide behind objects or dividers in their cells.
    - A guard must never enter a cell on an extermination day.
    - This day may only be played on maps that have hiding spots in every cell, unless you exclude cells without hiding spots, or allow for some leniency.
0. **Shrek's Swamp**
    - The warden will specify an area to be the *swamp*, and all guards must stay in the swamp and defend it from prisoners.
    - The guards must not leave the swamp, nor kill any prisoners whilst outside of the swamp; doing so will be considered RDM and dealt with accordingly.
    - Prisoners must be let out of their cells and permitted to get guns.

## Common Games

0. **First Reaction Last Reaction (FRLR)**
    - If the warden says "first reaction (command)", the first person to do it is KOS, and the last person to complete the order will be KOS if the warden states "last reaction (command)"
    - Once a prisoner has died, all remaining prisoners should reset and face the warden, unless specified otherwise.
    - The warden must state clearly that all prisoners are playing FRLR.
0. **Simon Says**
    - The warden must make it clear to all prisoners that they are now playing Simon Says. Once in effect, simon says is not over until Simon says it is.
    - If the warden gives an order by saying "Simon says (order)", all prisoners must do their order or they are KOS. If the warden doesn't say simon says, all prisoenrs to complete the order, or begin completing the order, will be KOS.
    - The warden doesn't have to state that they are Simon.
0. **Shoot or Don't Shoot**
    - All prisoners must face a wall lined up shoulder-to-shoulder; the warden then points a gun at a prisoner or the ceiling, and asks either that prisoner or another prisoner, "shoot or don't shoot". The prisoner that has been asked gets to choose whether the gun is fired or not, often choosing another prisoner's fate.
    - However, if the warden is aiming at the ceiling and the prisoner responds with "don't shoot", the prisoner who has been asked dies instead.
    - **Please note, there are other ways of playing this, but this is the most fair way to play; variations of this game may result in the warden being punished for favouritism.**
0. **Snitch**
    - When two prisoners remain, the warden may initiate snitch to decide who gets LR; both prisoners should stand back-to-back, and once the warden says "snitch", prisoners decide whether to crouch or remain standing.
    - If one prisoner crouches, the standing prisoner will be KOS, whilst if both crouch, both prisoners will be KOS. If both prisoners remain standing, neither will die.
0. **Spot the (Blank)**
    - If three prisoners remain, the warden may decide to play spot the (blank, often "faggot") to decide LR. The remaining three prisoners organise themselves into a triangle formation, facing away from each other, turning around to face another prisoner when the warden states "spot the (blank)".
    - The prisoner whom has two prisoners looking at them will be KOS. If no prisoner has two prisoners facing them, no one dies.

0. **Pardon**
    - A prisoner that has rebelled may request to be pardoned by the Warden, allowing them to join back in on the game or day being played.

0. **KOS Area**
    - A KOS area is an area that is considered off-limits to prisoners; entering one of these areas is considered rebelling, and the prisoner will be KOS, hence the name.
