    <!-- Brief Gamemode Intro -->
    <h1 class="button">How do I play Jailbreak?</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>So you've stumbled upon the world of Jailbreak, but you don't know where to get started with the gamemode... Don't worry, friend, I'll try and help you get your foot in the door! Although it may seem intimidating at first, once you get the hang of it, Jailbreak can be a lot of fun! Don't suffice this tutorial for a full introduction to our server, though, as you should always read the rules before playing!</p>

      <p>To start off, Jailbreak consists of two primary teams; these are the <span class=pris>prisoners</span>, who spawn in cells and follow the warden's orders, and the <span class=guard>guards</span> who manage the prison! The guards team, and especially the <span class=warden>warden</span>, are in charge of orchestrating the days, keeping track of prisoners, and most importantly, creating a fun experience for the prisoners team. The prisoners, on the other hand, have the option of participating in the warden's days and attempting to be the last prisoner alive, or if they dislike the day being played, rebelling, and attempting to eliminate the guards team!</p>

      <p>Whilst on the guards team, you must keep track of the prisoners during the day, and ensure that no prisoners try and rebel. You must follow the orders of the warden at all times, or alternatively, you may type "/warden", or hit F4, at the start of the round to claim warden yourself! As the warden, your role is to create games and activities for the prsioners to try and bring the prisoner count to one, whom then gets a Last Request, or LR. It's recommended you get experience before going warden, so watch what other wardens do, and spend some time on the prisoners team first!</p>

      <p>Speaking of prisoners... As a prisoner, you have the choice of following the warden's orders and trying to survive through the day, or rebelling, and attempting to eliminate the guards team. The warden will try different tricks to pick off prisoners, often even whilst you're in your cell, so be cunning and listen closely to what the warden says! If you manage to become the last prisoner left alive, you will get an LR, which allows you to suggest something to be played the following day, although it may be denied; alternatively, you can hit F4 to pit yourself one-on-one with a guard, and try to pick off the remaining guards to win the round!</p>

      <p>Hopefully this small introduction has helped you get more comfortable with the gamemode, and I wish you, dear reader, lots of fun whilst playing!</p>

    <!-- Jailbreak Rules -->
    <h1 class="button">Jailbreak Rules</h1>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Use your common sense. If you feel like you're doing something wrong, stop.</li>
        <li>Freekilling/RDM/Teamkilling will not be tolerated.</li>
        <li>Do not give intentional "freedays" under any circumstances.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This excludes "first day freeday" after a map change.</li>
            <li>Freedays may not be given as a Last Request.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Do not intentionally stall or delay the round (this includes cell days) or hide and wait for prolonged periods (camping).</li>
        <li>The Warden must communicate appropriately, whether it be by talking over voice chat or placing waypoints; if you can't communicate clearly, don't become the Warden.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Waypoints may be placed by holding C (default). Note: Waypoints do not count as specific orders, and must be accompanied with a command.</li>
            <li>It is adviced you refrain from becoming the Warden if your mic is of poor quality or you are hard to understand, all it does is make it a pain for the people trying to listen to you and carry out your orders.</li>
            <li>To avoid parts of your command being cut out, beging holding down your voice chat key before you give your command, and release it after you've finished speaking.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Guards must obey and protect the Warden at all times; do what he says when he says it.</li>
        <li>Prisoners and guards may refuse an order that will lead to certain death.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are ordered to jump off a building, or do anything else that will endanger your life, you may refuse the order.</li>
            <li>Orders that lead to the possibility of death may not be refused (i.e. certain games or days that kill off prisoners).</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Guards are not allowed to gunplant; do not bring and distribute weapons to prisoners under any circumstances. Failure to follow this rule will result in a lengthy ban.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is recommended you enable "double press to drop" in the settings (accessible by pressing F1) to avoid accidentally gunplanting.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Do not ghost/metagame. If you are dead, do not give the prisoners that are still alive any information that may have an effect on the day.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This includes answers to trivia questions; it's a test of their wit, not yours.</li>
            <li>Do not give rebellers hints that may heighten their chance at success, such as when hallways are clear, guard locations, or telling them escape routes. The reverse applies; don't tell guards the locations of rebelling prisoners.</li>
            <li>"Fake ghosting" may still be considered ghosting if it has an effect on the day.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Guards cannot interfere with a prisoner's Last Request; if they are having a battle, do not shoot the prisoner.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>However, if the prisoner is targeting guards other than their LR opponent, this counts as rebelling and the prisoner can be KOS.</li>
            <li>If a prisoner was rebelling before they initiated Last Request they may still be KOS.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Kill prisoners within reason. If they have a knife, don't just gun them down, you must ask them to drop it first.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If a prisoner has a gun, holstered or not, they may be KOS.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>You are not allowed to camp the armory, once you have chosen your weaponry you should leave it.</li>
        <li>Do not close cells once they have been opened, unless prisoners are to enter them later in the day.</li>
        <li>If a Warden has not given an order before 60 seconds after the start of a round, the day becomes a freeday.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If this occurs, do not keep prisoners in their cells, open the cells if they don't open automatically.</li>
            <li>Cell orders (such as touching and facing cell doors) count as orders.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>You cannot prevent prisoners from doing Last Request, and neither player may use the medic bay or health kits during Last Request.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If a day is still in progress (i.e. "the first prisoner to reach the end gets LR"), but everyone else dies, the Warden may refuse to give Last Request until the day is complete.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>All guards must communicate clearly with working microphones (this is based on admin discretion), and all guards must be willing to go Warden. Refer to rule no. 5.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>You must have, and use, a working microphone to be on the guards team.</li>
            <li>If you are not willing to take the Warden position, don't be on the guards team.</li>
            <li>Guards may only give simple orders, such as "drop your weapon" or "get back in line", leave the complex orders to the Warden.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If there are conflicting orders, the most recent order takes priority.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>For example, if the Warden says leaving the circle is KOS, then instructs the prisoners to move to the square, you may not KOS prisoners for leaving the circle.</li>
            <li>This rule is excepted during Simon Says, so listen closely. For example, Simon must say that leaving the circle is no longer KOS.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If you are the last guard alive you may KOS anyone who is holding a weapon; you may also try to take the position of Warden and give new orders - if prisoners do not comply they are rebelling (KOS).</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The last guard may not "kill all" without a valid, rule-abiding reason, such as a warday, or the prisoners are rebelling.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>We aren't here to simply win rounds, but to allow both teams to have fun. Don't make killing everyone your main objective, but instead, try to have fun and give everyone a chance to contribute and survive. This applies to both the prisoner team and the guard team.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are on the prisoner team, don't rebel every round. Rebelling is a healthy component of the game, but in excess, is simply not fun.</li>
            <li>Try to stray away from games and activities that remove a large group of prisoners purely on chance, it's not fun to miss out on a day simply because the dice wasn't in your favour.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, days which may be considered cruel and unfair for prisoners, such as Faze Clan recruitment day, are prohibited.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>No prop surfing or killing.</li>
        <li>Do not repeat days/games (i.e. don't play three wardays in a row).</li>
        <li>Cell days are prohibited.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Prisoners must be out of their cells by one and a half minutes after the start of the round.</li>
            <li>Cells may be used for games later in the day, but not in excess.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Games or days that require the use of the developer console are prohibited.</li>
        <li>As a guard, do not open the cell doors without your Warden's permission.</li>
        <li>First day special days which involve prisoners spawning with a weapon are to be treated as wardays; any other first day special day will continute to be considered a freeday.</li>
        <li>Cheap tricks which are used to confuse and kill off prisoners are prohibited.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>For example, unclear instructions, conflicting instructions/waypoints, or talking in a way that is too fast or unclear.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>If any invincible props, such as barricades, are being used to prop-block an area, item pickup must be enabled.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Anything is allowed except pressent any of your movement keys, crouching, or jumping (WASD, CTRL and space by default).</li>

            <li>Avoid camping on this day, save that for reverse hide and seek.</li>

        <li class="bold">Lava Day</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The floor is lava! After a specified time, all prisoners must be off of the floor, and/or on an object in their cell, otherwise they are KOS.</li>

      <ol>
        <li class="bold">First Reaction Last Reaction</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If the Warden states "first reaction (command)", the first person to do it will be KOS; if the Warden states "last reaction (command)", the last person to do it will be KOS.</li>
            <li>Once a prisoner has died all remaining prisoners should reset facing the Warden unless stated otherwise.</li>
            <li>The Warden must state clearly that the prisoners are playing First Reaction Last Reaction.</li>

            <li>If the Warden gives an order by saying "Simon says (order, e.g. crouch)", all prisoners must do this order or they are KOS.</li>
            <li>If the Warden gives an order without saying "Simon says", doing the order is KOS.</li>

        <li class="bold">Shoot or Don't Shoot</li>
          <ul>
            <li>All prisoners must face a wall lined up shoulder-to-shoulder; the Warden then points their gun at a prisoner or the ceiling, and asks either that prisoner or another prisoner "shoot or don't shoot". The prisoner that has been asked gets to choose whether the gun is fired or not, often choosing another prisoners fate.</li>
            <li>However, if the Warden is aiming at the ceiling, the prisoner who has been asked "shoot or don't shoot" dies instead.</li>
            <li class="bold">Please note, there are other ways of playing this, but this is the most fair way to play; other ways may result in the Warden being punished for favouritism.</li>
          </ul>
        <li class="bold">Snitch</li>
          <ul>
            <li>When two prisoners remain, the Warden may initiate snitch to decide LR; both prisoners should stand back-to-back, and once the Warden says "snitch", prisoners decide whether to crouch or remain standing.</li>
            <li>If one prisoner crouches, the standing prisoner will be KOS; If both prisoners crouch, both prisoners are KOS. Neither prisoner will die if both prisoners are standing.</li>

        <li class="bold">Spot the (Blank)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If three prisoners remain, the Warden may decide to play spot the (blank, often called spot the faggot). The remaining three prisoners stand in a triangle formation, facing away from eachother, turning around to face another prisoner once the Warden says "spot the (blank)".</li>
            <li>The prisoner that has two prisoners looking at him will be KOS.</li>

            <li>Last Request; provided they didn't rebel and it is not a warday, the last prisoner alive gets Last Request.</li>
            <li>The last prisoner may request a game/day to be palyed tomorrow if a Warden is alive, or alternatively, may challenge the guards to a trivia or a duel by pressing F4, killing all the guards one by one and winning the round for the prisoners.</li>
            <li>A prisoner that kills a guard during their Last Request duel is not KOS.</li>
